    <p>The Basic Language of the Web: <strong> HTML</strong></p>
    <p>Posted by <strong>True Engineer</strong> on Monday, June 21st 2027</p>
    <p> All modern websites and web applications are built using three fundamental technologies: <strong>HTML, CSS and JavaScript</strong>. These are the languages of the web.</p>
    <p>In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all about, and why you too should learn it.</p>
    <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
    <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It's a markup language that web developers use to structure and describe the content of a webpage (not a programming language). <br>
    <br>
    HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content: paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers understand HTML and render HTML code as websites.
    </p>
    <h3>In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:
    </h3>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>The opening tag.</li>
        <li>The closing tag.</li>
        <li>The actual element.</li>
        <li>You can learn more at the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/plus">MDN Web Docs.</a></li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Why should you learn HTML?
    </h2>
    <p>There are countless reasons for learning the fundamental language of the web. Here are 5 of them:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To be able to use the fundamental web dev language</li>
        <li>To hand-craft beautiful websites instead of relying on tools like Worpress or Wix</li>
        <li>To build web applications</li>
        <li>To impress friends</li>
        <li>To have fun ðŸ˜ƒ</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Hopefully you learned something new here. See you next time!</b></p>
